# Bluetooth Controlled Car using ESP32

This project demonstrates how to build and program a Bluetooth-controlled car using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Dabble app. The car can be controlled via a smartphone using the gamepad module in the Dabble app.

## Features
- **Bluetooth Control**: The car can be controlled wirelessly using the Dabble app.
- **Four-Wheel Drive**: Supports forward, backward, left, and right movements.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Uses PWM to control motor speed.

## Components Required
1. ESP32 Microcontroller
2. Motor Driver (L298N or equivalent)
3. DC Motors (x4 for a 4-wheel drive setup)
4. Power Supply (e.g., Li-ion batteries)
5. Bluetooth-enabled Smartphone with the Dabble App installed
6. Connecting wires

## Circuit Diagram
### Pin Connections:
| ESP32 Pin | Motor Driver Pin | Description         |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| GPIO25    | IN1              | Motor 1 control     |
| GPIO26    | IN2              | Motor 1 control     |
| GPIO27    | IN3              | Motor 2 control     |
| GPIO14    | IN4              | Motor 2 control     |
| GPIO32    | ENA              | Speed control motor 1 |
| GPIO33    | ENB              | Speed control motor 2 |

Connect the motors to the motor driver and ensure the power supply is sufficient for the motors.

## Installation
1. Install the [Dabble library](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.STEMpedia.Dabble) in your Arduino IDE.
2. Install the latest ESP32 board manager in your Arduino IDE.
3. Clone this repository or copy the code into a new Arduino sketch.

---

## Setup Instructions
1. Open the Arduino IDE and select the ESP32 board in **Tools > Board**.
2. Configure the correct COM port in **Tools > Port**.
3. Upload the code to the ESP32.
4. Open the Dabble app on your smartphone and connect to the ESP32 Bluetooth module (named "MyBluetoothCar").
5. Use the Gamepad module in the app to control the car.

## How It Works
- **Gamepad Controls**:
  - **Up Button**: Moves the car forward.
  - **Down Button**: Moves the car backward.
  - **Left Button**: Turns the car left.
  - **Right Button**: Turns the car right.
- The PWM signals generated by the ESP32 control the speed of the motors, and the digital signals determine the direction.

## Code Explanation
### Key Functions:
1. `Move(int right_wheels_speed, int left_wheels_speed)`:
   - Controls the direction and speed of the wheels.
2. `setUpPinModes()`:
   - Initializes the GPIO pins and configures PWM for speed control.
3. `setup()`:
   - Initializes pin modes and sets up the Bluetooth connection.
4. `loop()`:
   - Continuously processes input from the Dabble app and controls the car accordingly.

## Troubleshooting
1. **Bluetooth Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure the ESP32 is powered on and within range.
   - Verify that the Dabble app is connected to the correct Bluetooth device.

2. **Motor Not Responding**:
   - Check the connections between the motor driver and ESP32.
   - Ensure the power supply is sufficient for the motors.

3. **Unexpected Behavior**:
   - Verify the code logic and adjust pin configurations if necessary.
